Nanjaoh Group

This project is one of the final projects of AI and AR/VR courses in the 6th semester of Media Production. 
Nanjaoh Group is a charity project that immerses users in the daily journey of Papua Pegunungan children walking to school. The experience emphasizes emotional storytelling, cultural nuances, and visual style through a Virtual Reality website approach to raise awareness around access to education in remote areas. The realization of this concept begins with raising social issues regarding education in remote areas, one of which is the Papua Mountains. Infrastructure barriers such as roads, transportation, telecommunications, health, education, administration, bureaucratic systems, and local community participation are not fully independent when compared to provinces on the island of Java.

Through the course we are currently taking, the utilization of virtual reality-based media technology can be used as a creative innovation that can help achieve the welfare of the people in the Papua Mountains evenly.
